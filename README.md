i3-polybar

Well since I am not a fan from any DE's that are available for Linux I want to make a quick environment to use with my machines.
The files are all commented and there are no new stuff to them. 
What I will test is to make a symlink between the files from the repo and the machine so the edit can be flawless.

To make the configuration work 100% you must install the i3-gaps.
This package is already in the Arch Linux repository.

This repo is only for backup so I will not be taking any commits (like anyone even looks at my repos) :)
